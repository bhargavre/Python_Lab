# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

We were given a great opportunity to do a sentiment Analysis. I used this opportunity to do a twitter sentiment analysis on Snowden.

Please review the "sentiment_analysis_twitter.ipynb" file to see my work.

The twitter_datastream_snowden.txt file contains the tweets extracted using python API 'tweepy'

The poslist.csv, neglist.csv and stoplist.csv document is a list of words which is present in the tweets file.
