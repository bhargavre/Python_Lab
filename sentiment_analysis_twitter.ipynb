    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Snowden\n",
    "\n",
    "Edward Joseph Snowden is an American computer professional, a former CIA employee and a former contractor for the Unites States government who copied and leaked classified information from the NSA disclosing numerous global surveillance programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why did I pick Snowden?\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowden was a topic that was discussed about a lot at one point of time. Was it good or bad what Snowden did? Why is there a movie on him? I heard a lot of controversies about these topics. I too had a mixed reviews.\n",
    "* I wanted to do a sentiment analysis on this topic to get a general idea on how people think about this.\n",
    "* Is it positive or negetive?\n",
    "* A managerial insight could be whether this deed should be taken seriously by the govenment or not? Or is it right or wrong for the public to know this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How did I perform the sentiment analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "I am very very new to Python, so to start this I had to read a lot about how to code at first and then about what and how to do the sentiment analysis.\n",
    "The best part about this Assignment is that many have already done sentiment analysis before which helped me a lot to acquire the data i desired. \n",
    "Out of the many links that I read, I liked the below links\n",
    "* http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2014/07/twitter-analytics/\n",
    "* https://gist.github.com/yanofsky/5436496\n",
    "* https://dev.to/rodolfoferro/sentiment-analysis-on-trumpss-tweets-using-python-\n",
    "\n",
    "But for the extraction of tweets I followed the first link http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2014/07/twitter-analytics/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps I took to acquire the data\n",
    "First: I signed up with twitter and created an application.\n",
    "Second: I pasted the entire code from that link in Jupyter notebook (which included the secrect keys and access tokens) to see if it works, but it resulted in many errors.\n",
    "Second: I installed Python in my windows 10 system and created a python file with the code and ran it in my command line, but this resulted in the same errors.\n",
    "Third: I analysed the code line by line to figure out mistakes and started correcting it by trial and error method. Alas! it started working.\n",
    "Fourth: I then entered the tag \"Snowden\" in the code and ran the python file while i piped the output of the file into a text file on command line.\n",
    "I let this run for a few hours and it resulted in a text file with JSON output tweets (with metadata) of size 2.06 GB.\n",
    "Fifth: Since the size was huge to upload to jupyter notebook, i re-ran the python file and this time i stopped running it (Ctrl+C) about 15 minutes and this resulted in a text file of close to 500 tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Positive, Negetive & Stopwords\n",
    "Althought I have given GRE and learned words from Barons and Princetons list, I could not come up with positive, negetive and stopwords by myself. Hence, I googled this information and I found a list of these words that people have already used for their sentiment analysis. \n",
    "I simply pasted those words into a 3 different text files (positive, negetive and stopwords).\n",
    "##### Finally I was ready with my data that I needed to complete this sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Below is the code & steps I took to check whether the few tweets are inclining towards positive or negetive state\n",
    "As I am new to Python, I had to google codes based on my logic and I also had a lot of help from my friends. In doing so I learned a good deal about python.\n"
